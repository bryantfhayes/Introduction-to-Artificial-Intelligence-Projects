Project 3: The Sarcasm Detector
Author: Bryant Hayes

Goals: 
  1) Pre-process data into vectors
  2) Classify using naive bayes nets

How to use:
  
  python main.py <training> or <test>

  ex)
    - To run classifier on training set:
        
        python main.py training

    - To run classifier on test set:

        python main.py test

    ** In either case the training set trains the classifier to start
